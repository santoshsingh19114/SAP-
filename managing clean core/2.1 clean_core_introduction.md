# Clean Core in SAP S/4HANA Cloud

## 🌟 Introduction
Modern enterprises face constant challenges—rapid change, complexity, and the need to innovate fast. **SAP S/4HANA Cloud** helps overcome these challenges by managing business functions like finance, procurement, supply chain, and customer relations. However, being cloud-based means companies need a different approach to system management — known as **Clean Core**.

---

## 🧩 What is the “Core”?
The **Core** of an ERP system consists of five key dimensions:
- **Processes** – Business workflows and logic.
- **Extensions** – Customizations and add-ons.
- **Data** – Master and transactional information.
- **Integrations** – Connections with other systems.
- **Operations** – System management, performance, and upkeep.

---

## 🧼 What is “Clean”?
“Clean” means following best practices, tools, and methods for each dimension to keep the system simple, efficient, and compliant.  
A **clean system** = reliable, scalable, and easy to update.

---

## ⚙️ What is “Clean Core”?
A **Clean Core** ERP system is:
- **Up to date** with the latest releases.  
- Uses **cloud-compliant extensions and integrations**.  
- Has **high-quality data** and **efficient processes**.  

New SAP S/4HANA Cloud systems start clean — the challenge is to **keep them clean** over time.

## 🧠 Components of a Clean Core
1. **Minimalism:** Remove redundant or outdated features; keep only what’s essential.  
2. **Modularity:** Divide the system into smaller, independent modules for easy updates.  
3. **Scalability:** Handle growth and changes without hurting performance.  
4. **Maintainability:** Simplify the codebase for easy fixes and upgrades.  
5. **Stability & Reliability:** Fewer dependencies → fewer bugs and higher uptime.

> Goal: **Get the core clean → Keep the core clean.**
