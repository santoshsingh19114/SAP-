## ⚙️ The Problem: Legacy Systems and Technical Debt
Let’s take the example of a media production company called **The Gritty Pixel**. Despite producing world-class visuals, their old systems were causing serious issues:

### ❌ Challenges Faced:
- **Data Silos:** Departments worked in isolation, leading to poor communication and duplicated work.
- **Manual Processes:** Tasks like inventory updates and order management were time-consuming and error-prone.
- **Outdated Reports:** Decisions were based on stale data because reports took too long to generate.

This led to frustration, inefficiency, and reduced productivity.
