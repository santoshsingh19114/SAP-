# Clean Core Benefits for IT

## 🌟 Introduction
After exploring the benefits of a **clean core** for end users, it’s time to see how it transforms the **IT department**. Using the same example of **The Gritty Pixel**, we’ll look at how a clean core in **SAP S/4HANA Cloud** simplifies IT operations, reduces technical debt, and future-proofs the organization.

> **A clean core helps IT deliver business value faster while reducing complexity and maintenance effort.**

## 🧩 The IT Challenges Before Clean Core
Just like users, IT at The Gritty Pixel faced several issues due to legacy systems:

### ❌ Main Problems
- **Data silos and poor communication** between departments.
- **Manual, time-consuming tasks** like data entry and integration maintenance.
- **Lack of real-time insights** — decisions relied on outdated reports.

IT also had to maintain multiple systems, each customized heavily, which led to **high technical debt** — a burden of old code, patchwork fixes, and incompatible integrations.

> Legacy complexity made innovation slow and costly.

## ⚙️ Setting the Stage – IT’s Role
While users handle daily tasks, the IT department’s role is broader — they must provide the **technology foundation** to support company strategy. However, years of customization and disconnected systems made this nearly impossible.

When The Gritty Pixel decided to expand its business models (adding **Make-to-Stock** and **Financing** options), IT couldn’t move fast enough:
- Testing upgrades would take up to **one year**.
- Existing systems needed separate upgrade streams.
- The team faced a **backlog of UI change requests** and system issues.

Klaus, the IT manager, realized that continuing like this would prevent the company from innovating.

## 🚀 SAP S/4HANA Cloud: The Turning Point
Management decided to adopt **SAP S/4HANA Cloud** and **SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP)**. With a **greenfield implementation**, The Gritty Pixel achieved a **clean core from day one** — eliminating years of technical debt.

> SAP S/4HANA Cloud with a clean core enables business value without adding technical debt.

- **Sales, production, procurement, and inventory** workflows are aligned.
- No more time wasted revalidating business processes after updates.

**Result:** The company can adjust to new business models quickly and efficiently.

## ☁️ Cloud-Native Development Benefits
Klaus can now develop and extend applications easily using:
- **ABAP Cloud Development Model**
