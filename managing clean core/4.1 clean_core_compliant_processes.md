# Exploring How to Make Business Processes Clean Core Compliant

## 🌟 Objective
After completing this lesson, you will understand how to **keep business processes competitive** while **reducing their complexity** to make them clean core compliant.

> **Clean Core Mantra:** “Keep competitiveness while reducing complexity.”

## 🧩 1. What Are Clean Business Processes?
Clean business processes are **efficient, standardized, and adaptable workflows** that align with SAP’s best practices. They help organizations stay competitive while minimizing unnecessary complexity, redundant steps, and costly customizations.

**Goal:** To create a system that’s simple, scalable, and sustainable.

## 🏗️ 2. Establishing a Strong Foundation
Making processes clean core compliant starts with three key components:

### ✅ A. Organizational Structure
- Define clear **roles and responsibilities** across project teams (analysts, managers, developers, testers).
- Create a **Process Transformation Office** to ensure accountability and alignment.

### ✅ B. Technical Foundation
- Use the right tools and technologies to build scalable, secure, and cloud-ready systems.
- Combine **SAP S/4HANA Cloud** with **SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP)** for integration, analytics, and extensibility.

### ✅ C. Transformation Methodology
- Follow a clear, repeatable framework (like **SAP Activate**) for planning and executing process improvements.
- Continuously analyze, optimize, and innovate using feedback loops and performance tracking.

- **Impact on operations**

This ensures that the most critical processes receive the most attention and optimization.

### 📊 Two Perspectives:

- **Functional View:** Focuses on individual departments and tasks.

### 🧠 Recommended Approach:
- Identify end-to-end processes aligned with company goals.
- Group them into **commodity**, **differentiating**, and **innovative** layers.
- Apply capability mapping and pacing to prioritize improvements.
