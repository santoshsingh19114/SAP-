# Exploring How to Make Extensions Clean Core Compliant

## 🌟 Objective
By the end of this lesson, you will understand how to **implement extensions in a clean core–compliant way** so your ERP stays stable, upgrade-safe, and efficient.

> **Clean Core Extensibility Mantra:** *“Keep the extensions clean.”*

---

## 🧩 What Are Clean Extensions?
Extensions allow companies to add custom functionality to SAP S/4HANA Cloud. But if done incorrectly, they can:
- Increase technical debt
- Break during upgrades
- Slow performance
- Complicate future system changes

Clean extensions ensure that your system remains stable, cloud-ready, and easy to maintain.

---

## 🚫 1. Avoid Extensions When Possible
Before creating an extension, always check if the requirement can be met using:
- Standard SAP S/4HANA Cloud functionality
- SAP configuration options
- Best practices

Only when the standard cannot support the business need should an extension be considered.

### Governance Tips
- Document **why** the extension is needed
- Prove its **business value**
- Ensure it aligns with clean core strategy

---

## 🔄 2. Ensure Extensions Don’t Break Upgrades
A clean extension must:
- Not interfere with SAP standard code
- Remain stable during upgrades
- Be designed using **released APIs, BAdIs, and extension points**

SAP provides a clear extensibility model to guarantee this separation.

### Two Main Categories of Extensions
1. **On-Stack Extensions** (within SAP S/4HANA Cloud)
   - Type 1: Key User Extensions
   - Type 2: Developer Extensions

2. **Side-by-Side Extensions** (built on SAP BTP)
   - Type 3: BTP Extensions

> Rule of thumb: Use **Type 1 or 2** if tight coupling is needed. Use **Type 3** for loosely coupled scenarios.

---

## ☁️ 3. Cloud-Compliant Extensions
Cloud-compatible extensions must follow:
- **ABAP Cloud Development Model**
- **Clean Core Extensibility Frameworks**

### ABAP Cloud Key Rules
- Only approved ABAP Cloud object types
- Only released APIs (enforced via syntax checks)
- Development done in ABAP Development Tools (Eclipse)

---

## 🧱 4. Extensibility Frameworks
SAP provides two maturity models.

### **A. 3-Tier Development Model (Older Model)**
- **Tier 1:** ABAP Cloud only (mandatory for Public Edition)
- **Tier 2:** Use “wrappers” for unreleased APIs (Private/On-Premise)
- **Tier 3:** Classical ABAP (not clean, last resort)

### **B. Clean Core Level Concept (Newer Model)**
- **Level A:** Cleanest – uses fully released stable APIs
- **Level B:** Uses unreleased but stable APIs (no wrapper needed)
- **Level C:** Uses unstable APIs (upgrade risks)
- **Level D:** Not clean – high technical debt

> Preferred approaches: **Level A & B**

---

## 📝 5. Understand Requirements Before Extending
Once you confirm that an extension is necessary:
- Decide whether it should be **on-stack** or **side-by-side**
- Choose clean techniques first (ABAP Cloud)
- Avoid classic extensions unless absolutely needed

Use the **SAP Application Extension Methodology** to:
- Analyze extension needs
- Select the correct extension type
- Create a clean, future-proof design

---

## 🧾 Conclusion
To stay clean core compliant, ensure that extensions:
- Are used **only when needed**
- Never replace or duplicate SAP standard functionality
- Do not break upgrades (or get broken *by* upgrades)
- Follow cloud-compliant development models
- Use only **released, stable APIs and extension points**

> Clean extensions keep your ERP future-proof, upgrade-safe, and aligned with SAP innovation.
