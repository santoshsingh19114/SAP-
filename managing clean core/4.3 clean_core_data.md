# Exploring How to Make Data Clean Core Compliant

## 🌟 Objective
After completing this lesson, you will understand how to **keep data clean, accurate, and compliant** with modern standards in SAP S/4HANA Cloud.

> **Clean Core Data Mantra:** *“Keep the data clean.”*

---

## 🧩 What Does “Data” Mean in SAP S/4HANA Cloud?
SAP S/4HANA Cloud manages **three categories of data**:

### 1. **Configuration Data**
Defines organizational structure (company codes, plants, purchase orgs).

### 2. **Master Data**
Core business objects like customers, vendors, materials, GL accounts.

### 3. **Transactional Data**
Created as a result of business transactions:
- Sales orders
- Purchase orders
- Hiring records

Transactional data always has:
- A **time dimension** (date/time)
- A **numeric value** (amount/quantity)
- A link to **master data** (customer/vendor/product)

## 🧼 The Goal: Clean Data
Clean data must be:
- Complete
- Correct
- Consistent
- Timely
- Valid
- Unique

Let’s break it down.

---

## 🔍 1. Data Quality Dimensions
### ✅ **Accuracy**
Data must reflect real-world truth.
- Avoid incorrect entries
- Use validation rules
- Perform periodic quality checks

### ✅ **Completeness**
No missing fields or partial data.
- Enforce mandatory fields
- Define clear data entry standards

### ✅ **Consistency**
Data must follow the same rules everywhere.
- Standard naming conventions
- Reconciliation between systems

### ✅ **Timeliness**
Data must be up-to-date.
- Real-time updates
- Defined refresh cycles

### ✅ **Validity**
Data must follow business rules.
- Use dropdowns instead of free text
- Validate formats (email, dates, etc.)

### ✅ **Uniqueness**
No duplication.
- Use duplicate check tools
- Enforce unique keys

## 🛠️ Tools to Achieve Clean Data
SAP provides several tools to help customers maintain high data quality.

### **SAP Master Data Governance (MDG)**
- Central hub for master data management
- Ensures consistency across SAP & non-SAP systems
- Supports workflow approvals & data validations

### **SAP Information Steward**
- Analyzes data quality issues
- Helps measure data impact on key processes

### **SAP Datasphere**
- Combines data integration, cataloging, modeling & warehousing
- Recommended for modern data architectures

### **SAP One Domain Model (ODM)**
A harmonized data model enabling seamless exchange across SAP apps.

### **SAP Data & Analytics Advisory Methodology**
Guides architecture & governance for clean, scalable data designs.

## 📉 2. Data Volume Efficiency
Keeping data clean also means keeping it **lean**.

### ❌ Remove:
- Redundant data
- Unused data
- Outdated (“deadweight”) data

### Why?
Old or duplicated data:
- Slows down system performance
- Confuses users
- Increases storage cost

### ⭐ How to Maintain Efficiency
- Regular data audits
- Archiving unused data
- Use SAP ILM (Information Lifecycle Management) for automatic retention & deletion

---

## 🔒 3. Data Privacy Compliance
With growing data regulations (GDPR, etc.), companies must:
- Store only necessary personal data
- Maintain transparency
- Respect user rights

### Use SAP ILM to:
- Automate data retention rules
- Archive or delete sensitive data
- Decommission legacy systems safely

---

## 🎯 Benefits of Clean Data
Clean data leads to:
- Reliable insights (“data to value”)
- Stable and efficient business processes
- Lower total cost of ownership (TCO)
- Easier data exchange between systems
- Reduced privacy compliance risks

---

## 🧾 Conclusion
To maintain clean core data compliance in SAP S/4HANA Cloud:
- Follow modern data quality standards
- Remove outdated, unused, and redundant data regularly
- Ensure privacy compliance
- Use SAP tools such as MDG, Datasphere, ILM, Signavio, and ODM

> Clean data strengthens decision-making, reduces risk, and keeps your ERP operating at peak performance.
