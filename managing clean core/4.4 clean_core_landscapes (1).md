# Exploring How to Make Landscapes Clean Core Compliant

## Objective
Understand how to keep system landscapes **flexible, reliable, and clean core compliant**.

---

## 🌐 Clean Landscapes — Introduction
The *landscape* refers to all systems a company uses and how they integrate. Just like processes, data, and extensions, landscapes must follow clean core principles.

**Mantra:** **Keep the landscape reliable.**

---

## 🔌 Base Integrations on Standard APIs
Use SAP‑recommended modern interfaces:
- **OData APIs**
- **SOAP APIs**

These ensure:
- Stable, secure system communication
- Easier maintenance and upgrades
- Better integration with SAP solutions (Ariba, SuccessFactors, Fieldglass)

**Tool:** SAP Business Accelerator Hub → explore APIs, test in sandbox.

---

## 🔄 Use SAP Integration Suite
SAP Integration Suite is SAP’s official iPaaS (integration platform). It handles:
- **Routing** (decides where messages go)
- **Mapping** (transforming data formats)
- **Connectivity** (adapters for many systems)

Benefits:
- Works with OData & SOAP
- Faster implementation
- Easier testing and monitoring

---

## 📢 Use SAP Event Mesh for Event-Based Integrations
Event Mesh enables **asynchronous event-driven architecture**.

Example:
- Business partner address changes
- Event is raised
- Subscribed apps receive notification
- Apps fetch updated data or trigger follow-up tasks

Use cases:
- Real-time updates
- Microservices
- Cross‑system workflows

APIs & event objects can be explored on SAP Business Accelerator Hub.

---

## 🚫 Avoid Legacy Integration Methods
Avoid unless absolutely required:
- **RFC**
- **IDoc**

Why avoid?
- Not cloud-friendly
- Harder to maintain
- Greater upgrade risk

Prefer OData/SOAP for modern, clean integrations.

---

## 🛠 Use SAP Application Interface Framework (AIF)
AIF lets **business users** (not IT) fix interface errors.

Features:
- Central monitoring of all interfaces
- Alerts for specific errors
- Secure masking of sensitive data

Benefits:
- Faster issue resolution
- Reduced IT workload
- Cleaner, more manageable landscape

---

## 📘 SAP Integration Solution Advisory Methodology (ISA‑M)
A methodology to design clean, scalable integrations.

It provides:
- Integration patterns
- Architecture blueprints
- Best practices for cloud/hybrid landscapes
- Guidance for setting up an Integration Center of Excellence

**Tool support:** SAP Integration Assessment (part of Integration Suite).

---
