# Exploring How to Make Operations Clean Core Compliant

## **Objective**
After completing this lesson, you will understand how to keep SAP S/4HANA operations effective and efficient in alignment with clean core principles.

---

# **1. Clean Operations**
**Mantra:** *Keep the operations effective and efficient.*

Efficient operations are essential for delivering business value. A clean SAP S/4HANA Cloud operational model strengthens IT's role as a service provider and ensures business agility.

---

# **2. Clean Core in the End-to-End Value Chain**
Clean core principles must be embedded into:
- Governance frameworks
- Strategic and tactical decisions
- Daily operational processes

### **Assigning Ownership**
IT should own:
- End-to-end clean core monitoring
- Integrated processes
- Event management and escalations

### **IT Responsibilities**
- Integrated monitoring and alerts (data, extensions, custom objects, etc.)
- Defined procedures for incident handling
- Alignment with clean core governance models

---

# **3. Tools Supporting Clean Operations**
## **SAP Solution Manager** & **SAP Cloud ALM**
Both tools help operate cloud and hybrid landscapes.

### **SAP Cloud ALM (Recommended Tool)**
- Cloud-native and included with all cloud subscriptions
- Supports business continuity and clean core monitoring

### **Key Features:**
- Detect incidents
- Analyze root causes
- Correct issues
- Automate recurring activities

---

# **4. Release Management**
To maintain clean core compliance:
- Always stay on the *latest release*
- Public Edition → automatic updates handled by SAP
- Private Edition / On-Premise → customer-controlled updates

### **Key Requirement:**
Define a release adoption timeline and avoid system "freeze". Exception approvals should be rare and justified.

---

# **5. Regular Housekeeping Tasks**
Each company may differ, but here are essential tasks:

### **✔ 1. Design Efficient Background Jobs**
- Optimize job schedules
- Avoid unnecessary load
- Improve performance and resource usage

### **✔ 2. Avoid File Interfaces for Data Import/Export**
- File-based transfers increase security and consistency risks
- Use modern, secure integration methods instead

### **✔ 3. Review User Authorizations Regularly**
- Remove unnecessary access
- Reduce security risks
- Maintain compliance

---

# **6. Key Goals to Aspire To**
- Daily operations executed as planned
- Opt-in for periodic lifecycle upgrades
- Follow approved maintenance windows
- Use clean core metrics to guide decisions

---

# **7. Clean Core Dashboard**
Available through **SAP for Me** → Systems & Provisioning → Systems tab → *Clean Core Compliance*.

### **Dashboard Shows:**
- Software stack version
- Custom code objects count
- Business modifications
- Tier 1 extensions

### **Important Notes:**
- Available **only** for SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition
- Partners can be granted access
- Metrics collected only for productive systems
- Required authorizations:
  - `SC_CCCREAD`
  - `INSTDIST` (read) or `INSTPROD` (edit)
- Data is collected mainly via **Early Watch Alert (EWA)**

---

# **Conclusion**
Clean core compliance in SAP S/4HANA requires:
- Proper planning
- Regular review cycles
- Strong IT ownership
- Effective use of ALM tools

IT teams must view clean core not just as technical work, but as a **business service that drives real value**.
