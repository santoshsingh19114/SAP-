# Evaluating Clean Core Best Practices

## **Objective**
After completing this lesson, you will be able to describe SAP's recommended best practices to achieve and maintain a clean core.

# **1. Clean Core Best Practices Overview**
Clean core projects require strong preparation, clear principles, and disciplined execution. These best practices support all dimensions of clean core and help organizations simplify, standardize, and innovate.

**Key message:** *Achieving and maintaining clean core is a marathon, not a sprint.*

# **2. Preparing for a Clean Core Implementation**
Preparation focuses on two major areas:

A complete end-to-end evaluation helps identify what should be changed, improved, or eliminated.

### **Checklist for Assessment:**
- Review existing business processes, systems, and data structures
- Identify inefficiencies, redundancies, and challenges
- Gather stakeholder input (users, managers, executives)
- Explore opportunities for automation and simplification using SAP S/4HANA Cloud and SAP BTP

## **B. Establishing a Strong Governance Framework**
A solid governance model ensures alignment and accountability.

### **Key Elements:**
- Clearly defined roles and responsibilities
- Strong senior management support (funding + involvement)
- Alignment between IT strategy and overall business goals
- Processes to manage technical debt and custom code cleanup
